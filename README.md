# Building a pandemic index for sales forecast
This includes four main steps
- Understanding the data, i.e. trends, seasonality etc
- Detecting the changepoint of the demand pattern, i.e. at what period did this sudden shock start affecting the business.
- Capturing the causal impact of this sudden shock on the business
- Adding this impact as an index to the machine learning forecasted demands.

All steps are captured in this [notebook](https://github.com/anitaokoh/Building-a-pandemic-index-for-sales-forecast/blob/main/calculate_forecast_with_corona_index.ipynb). You can also find the article associated to this project here for more explaination.
